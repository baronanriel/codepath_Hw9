# codepath_Hw9

The honeypot deployed in this instance was the Modern Honeypot Network (MHN) using the Google Cloud Platform Suite of tools.

2. Any issues were encountered:

The issues that were encountered have all been with the set up, and most of those have been my own fault and improperly setting it up. 
One of the first issues was having access to the web application for mhn, without the toolbar to be able to deploy the sensors. 


3. A summary of the data collected: number of attacks, number of malware samples, etc.:

Most of the attacks in the above json are fairly boring and limited to network scans and relatively uninteresting 
network reconnaissance from various places around the globe.


4. Any unresolved questions raised by the data collected:
The unresolved questions mostly have to do with curiosity for why there are the sheer volume of scans throughout the world that would even manage to touch the honeypot.
